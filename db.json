To remove hairs, use a brush with stiff bristles, but for the period of molting, it is better to get a special glove for grooming. It will greatly facilitate the care of your pet's coat. Representatives of the breed molt twice a year: in autumn and spring. Bathing a bull terrier. Forget about regular water treatments: bull terriers don't need them. Bathe your pet as it gets dirty with a mild dog shampoo. However, rubbing the bull terrier's body with a sponge or towel is enough. Do you want to give your hair a healthy shine? Arm yourself with suede and walk it through the hairs. The effect will not be long in coming!"

In addition, it is desirable to at least partially protect the enclosure from rain and wind. Immediately after the appearance of the dog in the house, determine its own place for it, where the bedding or mattress, toys will lie. In the immediate vicinity of it there should be no direct sources of heat and drafts. For the bed, natural materials are preferred, which do not need complex cleaning. A sufficient number of toys will protect furniture and shoes from sharp teeth."

At the same time, the first molt occurs in the fourth or sixth month, when the “adult” wool cover replaces the puppy's down. In Pomeranian females, molting begins during estrus and after childbirth, so do not be afraid. However, permanent bald spots should make you think about changing your pet's diet and choosing new cosmetic products for hair care."
